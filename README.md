# InvoicePipe

## WHY

Manual invoice processing is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. InvoicePipe aims to automate the extraction and structuring of data from invoices and similar documents, enabling businesses to streamline their accounting workflows, reduce human error, and accelerate financial operations.

## WHAT

InvoicePipe is a Python-based project designed to analyze and extract structured data from PDF and image invoices using state-of-the-art AI models. It leverages the [QuantaLogic PyZerox](https://github.com/quantalogic/quantalogic-pyzerox) toolkit for document analysis, supporting a wide range of file types and vision-capable LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, etc.).

Key features:
- Automated extraction of invoice data from PDFs and images
- Support for multiple AI vision models
- Batch processing of documents
- Customizable extraction prompts and options
